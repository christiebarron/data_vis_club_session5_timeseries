Documents regarding the Data Visualization Club I am co-chairing. 

## Instructions 
### Data
We'll be using [Wikipedia Website Traffic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muonneutrino/wikipedia-traffic-data-exploration/input) available on Kaggle.

- `clean_data.zip` is a compressed folder with the cleaned datasets we will be using. 
- `data_wrangling.zip` is a compressed folder with the jupyter notebook used for data cleaning. Note the raw data used is NOT in this github repository. It is the `train_1.csv` file from the 

Within the clean_data folder, see the `data_codebook.xlsx` for descriptions of the data. We developed several cleaned versions of the data. The most useful is the long format dataset `pg_views-and-rank_long_1category.csv`. If you prefer wide format data, you can use `pg_views_wide_1category.csv` instead. For an extra challenge, use the `pg_views_long_3category.csv` document.

### Homework assignment:
Please come to our Nov 8th meeting prepared to present at least one visualization of the Wikipedia data you created. See Chapter 31 in Wexler and colleagues' (2017) The Big Book of Dashboards: Visualizing Your Data Using Real-World Business Scenarios. Use any software you'd like (e.g., a rough sketch by hand, excel chart, Tableau/PowerBI dashboard, R/Python figure). 

Additionally, we will discuss the following questions.
- How can we best decide the granularity of time to select when visualizing time data?
- Given Wexler and colleagues' examples of how to represent time a) on a heat map, or b) as a time series, in what circumstances might we prefer each of these techniques?
